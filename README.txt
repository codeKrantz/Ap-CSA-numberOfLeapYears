This is a program from my AP Computer Sciance A course

Here are the instructions:

Create a program on Replit called numberOfLeapYears that:
defines year1 and year2
loops over every year from year1 to year2 (inclusive)
Counts the number of leap years as it loops
After the loop, returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2

Hints:
Test multiple years for year1 and year2 to make sure it is functioning properly
Leap years are years that are divisible by 4
